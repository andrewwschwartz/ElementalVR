# ElementalVR
This was both my first Unity application and VR application. 

Here's a description of the app:

*Enter into the arena armed with the ability to control the elements. Spawn opponents by pulling the lever and defeat them by hitting them with your elemental powers. Game includes fireballs and ninja guard enemies. 
Coming soon in a future update: Ice powers, rock powers, electric powers, water powers,  multiplayer, more arenas, player health bar, heads up display, endless mode and more!!!*



Here we explored the basics of developing a VR experience. It was our thought to build something of the likes of Legend of Kora. However, since this was our first time developing in Unity and our first time building in VR, we only made and a few basic scenes, some locomotion, and combat.
